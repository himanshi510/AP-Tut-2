Advanced Programming [AP] Tutorial 2: Class, object, constructor, access modifiers, encapsulation

Object: instance of class that may contain attributes and methods

Constructor: a special method that is called when an object is instantiated

Access Modifiers: private, public, protected 

1. private Access:
Accessible within the same class only.
Not accessible from subclasses or any other classes.

2. Default (No Modifier) Access:
Accessible within the same package (folder/directory).
Not accessible from classes in different packages.

3. protected Access:
Accessible within the same package.
Accessible in subclasses, even if they're in different packages.
Not accessible from unrelated classes in different packages.

4. public Access:
Accessible from anywhere in the code, regardless of package.
Visible to all classes, including classes in different packages.

Encapsulation: Attributes of a class are private and we use getters and setters to access them.
